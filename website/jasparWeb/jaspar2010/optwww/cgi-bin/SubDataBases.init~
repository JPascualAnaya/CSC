DESCRIPTION	 The JASPAR CORE database contains a curated, non-redundant set of profiles,  derived from published collections of experimentally defined transcription factor binding sites for eukaryotes. The prime difference to similar resources (TRANSFAC, etc) consist of the open data acess, non-redundancy and quality. <br><B>When should it be used?</b> When seeking models for specific factors or structural classes, or if experimental evidence is paramount

###PHYLOFACTS
START_ENTRY
COLLECTION	PHYLOFACTS
BROWSE_KEYS	name,jaspar,transfac
POP_UP_KEYS	name,jaspar,transfac,sysgroup,MCS,type,medline
DESCRIPTION	The JASPAR PHYLOFACTS database consists of 174 profiles that were extracted from phylogenetically conserved gene upstream elements.See Xie et al., Systematic discovery of regulatory motifs in human promoters and 3' UTRs by comparison of several mammals., Nature 434, 338-345 (2005) and supplementary material for details. <br><B>When should it be used?</b>The JASPAR PHYLOFACTS matrices are a mix of known and as of yet undefined motifs. They are useful when one expects that other factors might determine promoter characteristics, such as structural aspects and tissue specificity. They are highly complementary to the JASPAR CORE matrices, so are best used in combination with this matrix set.

###FAMILIAL
START_ENTRY
COLLECTION	FAM
BROWSE_KEYS	name,included_models,class
POP_UP_KEYS	name,type,medline
DESCRIPTION	The JASPAR FAM database consist of models describing shared binding properties of structural classes of transcription factors. These types of models can be called familial profiles, consensus matrices or metamodels. The models have two prime benefits: 1) Since many factors have similar tagrget sequences, we often experience multiple predictions at the same locations that correspond to the same site. This type of models reduce the complexity of the results. 2) The models can be used to classify newly derived profiles (or project what type of structural class its cognate transcription factor belongs to). <br><B>When should it be used?</b>When searching large genomic sequences with no prior knowledge. For classification of new user-supplied profiles.

POP_UP_KEYS	name,type,medline
BROWSE_KEYS	name,species,class,family
POP_UP_KEYS	name,class,family,species,tax_group,acc,type,medline,comment
DESCRIPTION	The JASPAR POLII database consist of models describing patterns found in RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) promoters. Some of these correposnd to a known protein (like the TATA box), while some has no specific interactor (like DPE). Models are taken from published literature or public databases. <br><B>When should it be used?</b> When investigating core promoters from multicellular eukaryotes

###CNE
START_ENTRY
COLLECTION	CNE
BROWSE_KEYS	name,consensus
POP_UP_KEYS	name,consensus
DESCRIPTION	JASPAR CNE is a collection of 233 matrix profiles derived by Xie et al. (PNAS 2007) by clustering of overrepresented motifs from human conserved non-coding elements. While the biochemical and biological role of most of these patterns is still unknown, Xie et al. have shown that the most abundant ones correspond to known DNA-binding proteins, among them is the insulator-binding protein CTCF. <B>When should it be used?</b> When characterizing of regulatory inputs in long-range developmental gene regulation in vertebrates.

BROWSE_KEYS	name,species,class,family
POP_UP_KEYS	name,class,family,species,tax_group,acc,type,medline,comment
DESCRIPTION	All the PBM collections are built by using  new in-vitro techniques, based on k-mer microarrays. PBM matrix models have their own database which is specialized for the data: UniPROBE. The PBM HLH, collection is the set derived by Grove et al (Cell 2008). It holds 19 C. elegans bHLH transcription factor models<B>When should it be used?</b> Where it is important that each matrix was derived using the same protocol, focusing on bHLH factors

PBM matrix models have their own database which is specialized for the data: UniPROBE.The PBM, collection is the set derived by Berger et al (Cell 2008) including 176 profiles from mouse homeodomain<B>When should it be used?</b>Where it is important that each matrix was derived using the same protocol, focused on homeobox factors

        </font></i></b></font></p>
      <p><a href="http://pga.lbl.gov/rvista.html">rVISTA</a> was subject to the 
        same testing procedure and data as ConSite (described in manuscript).</p>
      <p>Worth consideration is that rVISTA is given several advantages during 
        this test:</p>
      <p><i>Circularity</i></p>
      <p>It is not known (nor possible to find out) whether the TransFac matrix collection is independent 
        from the sites we search for. Thereby, rVISTA has an advantage due to possible circularity in the testing procedure.</p>
      <p><i>Redundancy</i></p>
      <p>In addition, rVISTA includes a redundant matrix collection, i.e. they 
        have multiple models for several of the transcription factors. In our 
        experience with the TransFac database, many of these models are overly 
        specific (and sensitive to circularity problems) as they are built with 
        only a few sites</p>
      <p><i>Evolutionary distance measurements</i></p>
      <p>The available test sets are ill-suited to explore greater evolutionary 
        distances. With greater evolutionary distances, the alignment algorithms 
        probably favor ConSite even further, as VISTA/AVID alignment algorithm is optimized for rapid alignment 
        of more similar pairs of sequences. ConSite also allows users to submit 
        alignments from any algorithm through a standard format (ClustalW), which 
        makes it more flexible for future improvements in alignment methods.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b><i><font color="#000000" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sensitivity 
        testing</font></i></b></p>
      <p>In essence, the sensitivity is measured by analyzing how many of the 
        known sites in the set that are found using the appropriate models. Since 
        there is no possibility for users to view matrix models within rVISTA, 
        identification of appropriatee matrix models was based on matrix names 
        and biological knowledge.</p>
      <p><b>At 70% matrix threshold and 70% conservation cutoff, (all other settings 
        default), ConSite locates 62.5% of the true sites, while rVISTA can 
        find 52.5%.</b></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="4"><b><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Selectivity</font></i></b></font></p>
      <p>We measure how well the orthologous sequence analysis can filter out 
        false positives compared to single sequence analysis. The total number 
        of predictions using respective full matrix collection is used as an approximation 
        of the number of false positives, since most predicted sites are not biologically 
        relevant. There is no functionality for single sequence comparison within 
        the rVISTA system, instead we have aligned two identical sequences and 
        used that as input. Since rVISTA only uses the other sequence for identifying 
        regions of conservation, the results should be identical to single sequence 
        analysis.</p>
      <p>The total number of predicted sites using orthologous analysis divided 
        by the same results using a single sequence is used as a measure of the 
        filtering efficiency. Since this is an internal test, differences in matrix 
        collection size are not an issue. </p>
      <p><b>At the same settings as above, the ratio for ConSite is 0.136 (13.6%), implying 
        that about 87% of the noise is removed in the anlysis.</b></p>
      <p><b>The corresponding test for rVISTA generates a ratio of 0.166 (16.6%).</b></p>
      <p>It is also worth pointing out that rVISTA, partly due to the redundancy 
        and low information content models in their matrix collection generates, 
        on average, <b>4-5 as many predicted sites</b> as ConSite using any combination of settings.</p>
      <p><i><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Conclusion</font></b></i></p>
      <p>Even without taking into account ease of use and functionality,&nbsp; ConSite still outperforms 
        rVISTA in both sensitivity and selectivity, despite that rVISTA is given 
        several advantages during the test.</p>

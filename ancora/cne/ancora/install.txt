To install or update Ancora, copy the files in
 Bio-Das-ProServer
 cgi-bin
 conf
 html
to their corresponding locations in the Ancora web directory.

For example:
cp -rp Bio-Das-ProServer cgi-bin conf html /opt/www/ancora

Additional components (GBrowse and Bio-Das-ProServer) must be installed
in the Ancora web directory. See cne/doc/ancora_technical_doc.html for details.

As an alternative to copying files from a checked-out package to
the Ancora web directory, the directory cne/ancora in the checked-out package
can be used as a web directory directly. This may be preferable for a test site,
so that any changes made can be easily commited to the repository.
The downside with this method is that GBrowse and other files will be mixed
with the files in the Ancora package.

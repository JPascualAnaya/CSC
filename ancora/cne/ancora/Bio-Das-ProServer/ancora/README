This directory should contain all Ancora-specific files.
The other directories under Bio-Das-Proserver should be the original
files from the Proserver distribution unless patches are required.

The only patch applied so far is the addition of the following line to coordinates/registry_coordinates.xml:
  <COORDINATES uri="" taxid="7227" source="Chromosome" authority="BDGP" test_range="" version="5.4">BDGP_5.4,Chromosome,Drosophila melanogaster</COORDINATES>

Files in this directory:
ancora_das       Init script. A copy should be present in /etc/init.d
start_proserver  Script called by ancora_das to start proserver
proserver.ini    Proserver config file

To start proserver do:
sudo /etc/init.d/ancora_das start

To stop it:
sudo /etc/init.d/ancora_das stop

To stop and start it:
sudo /etc/init.d/ancora_das restart

This document describes how to create an AT-type annotation datbase
for a genome assembly.

DOWNLOAD DATA FROM UCSC

Go to genome.ucsc.edu and download the following files from the
annotation database for the assembly of interest.

all_est.*	    # EST to genome mappings
all_mrna.*	    # GenBank mRNA to genome mappings
refSeqAli.*	    # RefSeq (NM_) to genome mappings
gbCdnaInfo.*	    # Additional info about mapped sequences
cds.*		    # CDS coords in transcript sequence
refSeqStatus.*	    # Status (Provisional, Reviewed etc) for RefSeqs
mrnaClone.*	    # Clone ids for transcript sequences
library.*	    # Library ids for transcript sequences

UCSC updates their transcript mappings weekly, leading to changes in all of
these tables. For consistency, it is therefore important the all files are
downloaded at one occasion. Annotation not directly related to transcript
mappings can be downloaded at a later time. Examples of such annotation are
gap and repeat locations.

I find the easiest way to download the files is to use commandline ftp. Open an
ftp connection to hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu. Make sure to start ftp with the -i
flag:
ftp -i hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu
Log in as anonymous with your e-mail as password. Change to the appropriate
directory and get the files with the mget command.

Unzip the zipped files.

CREATE DB AND TABLES

1. Create a new database using the mysql client.
E.g.: CREATE DATABASE AT_HS_MAY03;

2. Create the MAPPING, HSP and CONFIG tables by running
AT/SCRIPTS/create_AT_tables.sql E.g.: mysql -p -h nautilus AT_HS_MAY03
<create_AT_tables.sql

3. Create the cds, mrna and refSeqStatus tables as specified by the
   CREATE statements in cds.sql and gbCdnaInfo.sql and refSeqStatus.sql,
   respectively. UCSC used to call the gbCdnaInfo table mrna, hence the
   name discrepancy. Do not create any indexes at this stage. That is,
   exclude the lines starting with "KEY" from the CREATE statements.
   This speeds up table loading.

LOAD MAPPINGS

1. The files all_est.txt, all_mrna.txt and refSeqAli.txt contain
mapping data to be loaded. Look at the files all_est.sql,
all_mrna.sql and refSeqAli.sql to determine whether the first
column in each file is called 'bin' or 'matches'.

2. Use the script AT/SCRIPTS/mappings2sql.pl to populate the db with
mappings. First run the script without any options to see the
syntax. Then run the script once for each of the three data
files. Note the following: - The target_db option should be set to the
name of the corresponding AT-type genome assembly database. In the
current naming scheme, this is the same as the mapping datbase but
without the "AT_" prefix (e.g. HS_MAY03).  - The -b option should be
given if and only if the first column in the file to be loaded is a
bin-column.  - Set the mRNA|EST option to mRNA for all_mrna.txt and
refSeqAli.txt and to EST for all_est.txt.

E.g.  perl mappings2sql.pl -u engstrom -f all_mrna.txt -d AT_HS_MAY03 -t
HS_MAY03 -h nautilus -b mRNA

There may be problems with file permissions unless you run this script
on the machine running the sql server.

LOAD OTHER ANNOTATION DATA

Use the mysqlimport command to load the data in cds.txt, mrna.txt and
refSeqStatus.txt into the corresponding tables. Again, there may be
problems with file permissions unless you run this command on the
machine running the sql server.

About mrna.txt. This file can be very large; make sure the entire file is
loaded.

Most of the data in the file is for mrna sequence not in the MAPPING table, so
we can greatly reduce the size of the mrna table. Do the following:
-Create a new table mrna2 with using the statement in mrna.sql (without
indexes).
-Execute:
insert mrna2 select distinct mrna.* from mrna, MAPPING where mrna.acc =
MAPPING.qName;
drop table mrna;
alter table mrna2 rename as mrna;

INDEX THE TABLES

Index the tables by running the commands in AT/SCRIPTS/index_AT_tables.sql
E.g.: mysql -p -h nautilus AT_HS_MAY03 <index_AT_tables.sql

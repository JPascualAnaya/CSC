Planned modules
---------------

Par has a whole buch of modules under AT::FT that are not yet commited since
they are currently in a state of constant change. These include methods for
post-processing and analysis of transcript-genome mappings and gene
structure inference.

Par also believes a base class AT::ALN::Generic should be written and there
is some skeleton code on his machine. The reason is that several classes
really represent alignments (AT::Mapping, AT::Alignment::* + some uncommted).
So there should be a base class with common functionality. Requirements:
-represent alignments with or without sequences
-do coordinate conversion between sequences quickly (not like Bio::SimpleAlign)
-lazy load sequences from sequence databases
-slicing and merging
-statistics: id calculations

TODO
----
- base alignment class
- base genomic coordinate class

#Ancora technical documentation
First version by Pär Engström, April 2008. This version by Ge Tan, May 2013. This document was produced by the [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown "Markdown").

This document describes the implementation the Ancora web resource. For a general description of Ancora and its user interface, see the [Ancora publication](http://genomebiology.com/2008/9/2/R34 "Ancora publication").

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
 This documentation focuses on the Ancora installation on Olifant at csc. Olifant is running the CentOS release 5.8 (Final). However, ancora is supposed to run on other Linux/Unix distribution without too much difficulty.

<h3 id="dependencies">Software dependecies</h3>
 The following softwares are essential for the whole implementation.
 
 *	A httpd server (Currently [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/ "Apache") 2.2.3 is used on olifant)
 *	[MySQL](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html "MySQL") client if you have a dedicated MySQL server. if not, MySQL server is alse required. (MySQL 5.0.95 is used on olifant)
 *	[BioPerl](http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Installing_BioPerl_on_Unix "BioPerl"). Installation is quite straightforward following the instructions. (BioPerl 1.6.1 is used on olifant.)

<h3 id="GBrowse2">GBrowse2</h3>
This implementation of Ancora utilizes the latest version of GBrowse 2.54. GBrowse 2.X is a complete rewrite of GBrowse 1.X version. There are several advantages compared to the GBrowse 1.X. See the [details](http://gmod.org/wiki/GBrowse_2.0_HOWTO#Installation_from_Source_Code "GBrowse").

Since the GBrowse 2.X is perl-based and all the modules are hosted on [CPAN](http://search.cpan.org/~lds/GBrowse-2.54/), the easiest way to install GBrowse 2 is using the standard Perl module building procedure.

For a smooth installation, please install some prerequisites before launching the GBrowse2 installation. Details are mentioned on the [page](http://gmod.org/wiki/GBrowse_2.0_Prerequisites). It is highly recommened to use the common package managers, Debian(DEB) or RedHat Package Manager(RPM).

After installing the prerequisites, run this command in terminal

```bash
sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bio::Graphics::Browser2'
```
If not all the necessary prerequisites are installed, it will be notified during the test step. During the installation, there are some prompted configuration questions. On olifant, we configrued as follows:

*	Directory for GBrowse's config and support files? [/etc/gbrowse2] /opt/www/gbrowse2/conf
*	Directory for GBrowse's static images & HTML files? [/var/www/html/gbrowse2] /opt/www/gbrowse2/html
*	Directory for GBrowse's temporary data [/var/tmp/gbrowse2] /opt/www/gbrowse2/tmp
*	Directory for GBrowse's sessions, uploaded tracks and other persistent data [/var/lib/gbrowse2] /opt/www/gbrowse2/lib
*	Directory for GBrowse's example databases [/var/lib/gbrowse2/databases] /opt/www/gbrowse2/databases
*	Directory for GBrowse's CGI script executables? [/var/www/cgi-bin/gb2] /opt/www/gbrowse2/cgi-bin
*	Internet port to run demo web site on (for demo)? [8000]
*	Apache loadable module directory (for demo)? [/etc/httpd/modules]
*	User account under which Apache daemon runs? [apache]
*	Automatically update Apache config files to run GBrowse? [y]
*	Automatically update system config files to run gbrowse-slave? [y]

After the installation, the GBrowse2 demos should be accessable now. Type ```YourServersIP/gbrowse2``` in the internet browser and try the example database *yeast*.

However, because of some bugs in ```Bio::Graphics 2.33```, the tracks generated by plugins might complain some errors like 

```bash
Can't locate object method "height" via package "gdTinyFont"
(perhaps you forgot to load "gdTinyFont"?) at /usr/local/share/perl/5.8.8/Bio/Graphics/Panel.pm line 641. at
/usr/local/lib/perl/5.8.8/Bio/Graphics/Browser2/Render.pm line 3678.
```
As long as Lincoln D. Stein does not fix the bug, just downgrade to the ```Bio::Graphics 2.32```. Here is the trick how to do it.

```bash
wget http://backpan.perl.org/authors/id/L/LD/LDS/Bio-Graphics-2.32.tar.gz
tar xzf Bio-Graphics-2.32.tar.gz
perl Build.PL
./Build
./Build test
sudo ./Build install --uninst 1
```
The "--uninst 1" will make sure that the files for the
newer (2.33) version are removed in case they are installed in another directory.

**Note**: For some unknown reasons, the tracks are not displayed on Mac OS 10.8.3 with Firefox 20.0, Safari 6.0.4 and Opera 12.15. However, Chrome 26.0.1410.65 works fine. So far, it works on Windows 7 with all major browsers.

<h3 id="GBrowse2Ad">GBrowse2 Advanced Installation</h3>
This section is optional and incomplete. The advance installation should cover the topics such as *FastCGI*, *User Account Database*, *Displaying Next Generation Sequencing Data*, *Configuring the Uploaded Track Database*.

<h4 id="FastCGI">Running GBrowse under FastCGI</h4>
The idea of FastCGI is to make the script as a long-running process at the first time of the script is requested. By eliminating the startup time for later use of script, the responsiveness of a FastCGI is significantly improved.

To use this facility, you will need a version of Apache equipped with FastCGI support, the module [mod_fcgid](http://httpd.apache.org/mod_fcgid/). For a Debian (DEB) based system,

```bash
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-fastcgi libfcgi-perl
```
or for Cent OS,

```bash
cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
wget http://centos.karan.org/kbsingh-CentOS-Extras.repo
sudo vim /etc/yum.repos.d/kbsingh-CentOS-Extras.repo 
# set gpgcheck to 0 and enabled to 1 in the [kbs-CentOS-Testing] section.
yum install mod_fcgid
# Down the latest atomic-release rpm from http://www6.atomicorp.com/channels/atomic/centos/5/x86_64/RPMS/
# Install atomic-release rpm:
rpm -Uvh atomic-release*rpm
yum install fcgi-perl
```

The configuration of GBrowse2's FastCGI for Ancora will be addressed later.

**Note**: Because the olifant has a old version of *Apache* and *mod_fcgid*. You may need to adapt the GBrowse2 conf file for Apache (Fon instance, /etc/httpd/conf.d/gbrowse2.conf on olifant) to the older version of *mod_fcgid* with the names mapping descripted on [page](http://httpd.apache.org/mod_fcgid/mod/mod_fcgid.html).

<h3 id="UCSC">UCSC Genome Browser source and utilities</h3>
The UCSC Genome Browser source code is needed to compile the C program for detecting CNEs, which makes use of several library functions from the UCSC source. The UCSC Genome Browser source also contains a collection of useful utilities, some of which are needed at steps below. It is recommended to compile all the UCSC utilities by following the instructions in the README file in the UCSC source package. Short story on olifant,

```bash
export MACHTYPE=x86_64
export MYSQLINC=/usr/include/mysql
export MYSQLLIBS="/usr/lib64/mysql/libmysqlclient.a -lz"
export PATH=$HOME/bin/$MACHTYPE:$PATH
mkdir -p $HOME/bin/$MACHTYPE.
wegt http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/jksrc.zip
unzip jksrc.zip
cd kent/src
make libs
cd utils/
make
```

<h3>Browse HCNEs in external genome browsers</h3>

The <a href="/cgi-bin/gbrowse/">Ancora genome browser</a> provides the most
flexible way to explore the Ancora data.
However, it is also useful to view the data in other browsers where it can be compared
to annotations not present on this site.
  
<p><a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/" class="plain"><b>UCSC Genome Browser</b></a>
<p>
<!-- One advantage of viewing HCNEs in the UCSC Genome Browser is the possibility to compare
them to chained alignments between genomes. These alignments are often a good indication of
conserved synteny blocks.-->
All files in our downloads section can be uploaded as custom tracks to the UCSC Genome Browser.
Please visit the <a href="downloads/">downloads section</a> for more details.

<p><a href="http://www.ensembl.org/" class="plain"><b>Ensembl</b></a></p>
<p>Much of the Ancora data is accessible through the
<a href="http://www.biodas.org">DAS protcol</a> for exchanging sequence annotations. 
Ensembl can display sequence annotations provided in this way.
We have created a form by which HCNE data easily can be added to ContigView in Ensembl.
Once you have added a track to Ensembl in this way,
Ensembl will remember it as part of your preferences, so
that you do not have to add it again until your Ensembl preferences expire.

<!--
<p><b>Other genome browsers</b></p>
<p>Ancora data can also be viewed in other genome browsers that support the DAS protocol.
The <a href="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/developer/tools/download_igb.affx">Integrated Genome Browser</a>
from Affymetrix is one such browser.
You will have to provide the browser with the URL for our DAS server, which is
<a href="http://ancora.genereg.net/das">http://ancora.genereg.net/das</a>.
